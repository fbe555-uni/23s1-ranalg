#+TITLE: Hashing functions

* Universal hashing

** Application - signature
The probability of signature collision was bound first using the union bound, then afterwards using markovs inequality. The first method is the better one.

** Example hash function - $h(x) = ((a x + b) mod p) mod m$
pick any prime
